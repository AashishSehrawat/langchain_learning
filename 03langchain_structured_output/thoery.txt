1. In this repo, we work to get structured ouput like json format by out llms.
2. There are two types of llms:
    -> those which doesn't have power to give structured output
    -> those which have powert to give structured output
3. langchain provide the methods to work with both types of llm models
4. In llm which have the power to generate the structured output we use with_structured_output() methods
    -> 3 ways to generate structured output
        1. typedDict
        2. pydantic
        3. json_schema
